# communication with AI by voice chat
This idea is from my another project that is led by my teacher.My first concept is create a GUI to make it more convenient
for  users to use AI.<br />

The requirements of this project :
1.TTS(Text To Speech) and STT(Speech To Text) from the Azure <br />
2.the model of vicuna. I get this model from the hugging face and its name is lmsys/vicuna-7b-v1.5<br />
3.the model of llama.cpp . from https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp .We need this to accelerate vicuna to generate reply br />
4.QT to create GUI or find java Spring boot to make web

### Third commit 
At third commit ,you need to open the llama.cpp server on your work environment and then it can run the code<br />
At this, we can commit a .wav on the input_wav , then use the code to create AI .wav on the output_wav
